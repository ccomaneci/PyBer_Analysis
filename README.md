##1 Overview of the analysis

In this challenge we were given ride share data and using some of the skills we learned last challenge, along with using new skills, we broke down the information provided to us. Some of the things we were able to determine from the information was the number of drivers in the different city types, what the average cost of fares are for those same city types and how often do customers use a ride share in their city. 

##2 Results

###We took our data and used it to tell us different results for 3 city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. One of the first things I noticed is that the Urban city type had more riders, drivers, and profit than the other types. In the rural area we found there was a total of 125 rides, the average cost was about 34.62 of each ride and there was a total of 78 drivers, bringing in a total profit of $4,327.93. In the suburban area we found there was a total of 625 ride, 490 drivers, average fare of $30.97, which gave the total profit of $19,356.33. For the urban area there as a total of 1,625 rides, 2,405 drivers, total profit of $39,854.38 and an average fare cost of $24.53 [1].

##3 Summary

###Because urban areas tend to be more populated then rural and suburban areas, they have access to more customers. Due to the convenience of stores, shopping, and increase probability of tourism, the need for ride share services are greater. Because the need of ride share service is greater than the other city types, it created an opportunity to have access to more drivers. With more people and drivers in urban areas, it can influence the average fare cost. In the urban areas I believe the fair cost was much lower than the fare in the rural area because of the amount of drivers. There were more drivers being used in the urban city than there were total rides, it's possible that to remain competitive with pricing lower cost was offered. In rural areas the need for rideshare is not as great as the other areas however they were able to charge more for their services due to having a shorter demand and having enough drivers to not exceed the need of riders. It could be a good idea to decrease some of the drivers being used in urban cities to help bring the over all profit up even higher. Yes, the urban area made more then the other areas however that was with the help of increased customers. If less drivers are used, you can lower the cost of splitting profit among the excess of drivers [1].
